# UFCthe_most_dominant_weight_div
My capstone project - with the goal to figure out which weight division is the most exciting, as well as maybe crowning a greatest of all time.
The UFC has been a around for quite sometime now deliverying some of the best sports entertainment has to offer since it's establishment (November 12, 1993).
This unique combat sport has survived the most ardent attacks from lawmakers for one reason above all else; it's awesome. The electrifying nature of the UFC inspired me to take up the mission of trying to figure out which weight division in the UFC is the most exciting of them all. With a methodology in place, I also hope to discover who is the G.O.A.T. (the greatest of all time).
The methodology that went into defining the most exciting weight division  
  I will be using what will be called "wow points".
  Wow points will be derived from several sources: the amount of "fight of the night" awards, the amount of individual performance bonuses, the number of bouts with striking greater than average, and the number if     KO/TKO/SUB finishes.
  Each one of these instances will net their respective weight division "wow points", as well as the individual fighters that earned the awards and finishes.
