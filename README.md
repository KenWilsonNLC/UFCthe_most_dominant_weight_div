# UFCthe_most_dominant_weight_div
My capstone project - with the goal to figure out which weight division is the most exciting, as well as maybe crowning a greatest of all time.
The UFC has been a around for quite sometime now deliverying some of the best sports entertainment has to offer since it's establishment (November 12, 1993).
This unique combat sport has survived the most ardent attacks from lawmakers for one reason above all else; it's awesome. The electrifying nature of the UFC inspired me to take up the mission of trying to figure out which weight division in the UFC is the most exciting of them all. With a methodology in place, I also hope to discover who is the G.O.A.T. (the greatest of all time).
The methodology that went into defining the most exciting weight division  
  I will be using what will be called "wow points".
  Wow points will be derived from several sources: the amount of "fight of the night" awards, the amount of individual performance bonuses, the number of bouts with striking greater than average, and the number if     KO/TKO/SUB finishes.
  Each one of these instances will net their respective weight division "wow points", as well as the individual fighters that earned the awards and finishes.

My motivation for this project is to show how certain gyms/teams have faired in the UFC, and how they shaped the UFC as we know it today.
#Motivation
I chose this project because I feel that there certain gyms/teams that helped shape the UFC as we know it today.
My motivation for this project is to prove that my bias for certain weight divisions is supported by data.
#Data Question
Which weight class is the most excitingin the UFC?

The rise and fall of certain gyms/teams over the span of the UFC, and how they caused the sport to change.
•	Numbers of wins and losses for given fighters in the gyms.
•	Which gyms had the most champions?
•	For wins, how did they come? Via strikes, submissions, or decisions?
•	Which fighters got the most fight related performance bonuses?

#Minimum Viable Product (MVP)
Define your MVP. This should be a description of what your final capstone will look like, including visualizations, how the analysis will be presented, who the intended audience is, etc.

My plan is to scrape data from UFCstats.com. I expect to get enough table data to construct some meaningful graphs to include in a PowerPoint presentation. My intended audience are mma enthusiasts and fight fans. 

#Data Sources
I am scraping data from UFCstats.com. There seems to be an immense amount of data there.
Known Issues and Challenges
Explain any anticipated challenges with your project, and your plan for managing them. Be sure to include:

●	I will need to figure out exactly how to scrape the data
●	I also expect to have challenges coming up with exciting ways to demonstrate my findings
