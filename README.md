# The Ultimate weight class - finding the best weight class
My goal is to find the most exciting weight division in the UFC overall. The methodology I’ve put together provides an unbiased quantitative look into the UFC’s fight metrics, by assigning points to the normalized rank for each division in each specific category.

The UFC has been a around for quite sometime now deliverying some of the best sports entertainment has to offer since it's establishment (November 12, 1993).
This unique combat sport has survived the most ardent attacks from lawmakers for one reason above all else; it's awesome. The electrifying nature of the UFC inspired me to take up the mission of trying to figure out which weight division in the UFC is the most exciting of them all.
- The methodology   
  Using data on submission percentage, TKO and KO percentage, split decision percentage, and performance bonus percentage, I created a system to score each of the mentioned events. Every occurrence of the previously mentioned happenings will be assigned a point and whichever weight division has the most points in the end wins.
  In order to score the different aspects of the fight data, I assigned points for specific metrics. Each weight class will be awarded a score ranging from 1 through 12 for each of the following categories. 1 point will be given for the class that ranks lowest, and 12 points will be given for the class that ranks highest.
#Executive Summary
My motivation for choosing this subject, stems from my love of combat sports, and my belief that the UFC is the pinnacle of hand-to-hand competition. Every martial artist in the UFC has the talent and determination to become champions in any fighting league on the planet.

#Motivation
I chose this project because I feel that lighter divisions hold the best talent in the UFC, and I wanted to form a fair way to either prove or disprove my belief.
